People would be way more psyched for fund this than whatever bullshit smart phone application that they know will a complete loss with 98% certainty.  The west coast is awash with socially engaged filthy rich people who want to leave a positive legacy - the flip side of our current income inequality.  There's a lot of talk about overhauling education in the tech world.  This is totally possible.  


Concept: 

Grounded in the past, prepared for the future.  

'Whole person' curriculum:

		Environmental appreciation and stewardship 
	Leadership
		Student involvement in all aspects of educational experience
		Student run outdoor orientation for incoming student body 
		Maximum participation of students in school operations 
	Work Ethic 
		Student run enterprise (something along the lines of deep springs cattle operation)
		Mandatory internship (increasingly available telecommuting options available for this, particularly with tech emphasis)
		School runs year round (3 year graduation could be another selling point)


Student Results:
