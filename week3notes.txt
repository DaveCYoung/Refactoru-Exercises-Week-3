Javascript Functions!  

Looking for more depth in functions, mastery over javascript functions.  


Truthyness...  
Zero is falsey
'' is falsey
null and undefined are falsey
there or no falsey arrays or objects.  

angular.module function === 'overloaded function'or 'polymorphism' - can preform different functions depending on inputs



using callbacks 

a function that you define but don't call.  it goes to another function that calls it as needed.

cautionary: angular doesn't play well with setTimeout or setInterval.  if you change scope variables in a timeout, angular might not notice the change.  use angulars $timeout and $interval instead. 


objects dont' get sorted.  arrays can be sorted.  

CLOSURE...  look it up.  

javascript - functions are first class citizens ie. they can go anywhere other values can go.  anywhere a value can go, a function can go.

---------- Tuesday Notes -------------------


functional programming - style of programming that is heavily reliant on functions.

javascript well suited for functional programming.  

break a large problem into smaller problems  

writing composable functions - programming buzz word meaning they can be used in concert with other functions 

when possible using pure functions - ie no side effects

for functional programming your data should be immutable - cannot be changed.  want to treat data as stateless.

for loops are statements. 
 

.forEach () - built into javascript, every array has this method 

myArray.forEach (function(element))

MAP takes an input array and returns a new array of the same length, with each element transformed in some way. 

angular - filter feature.  look into it.  filters array and returns new array.

MAP, FILTER, REDUCE 

Reduce.  takes input and reduces to single value.  takes an array input, reduces it to single value.
